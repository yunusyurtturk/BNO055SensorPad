# BNO055SensorPad
A CLI/C++ form application. BNO055 Data Viewer and more

I didn't intent to share this codebase publicly, it was just a tool for my experiment/hobby projects. 

It is difficult but If you are really passionate and dedicated, you can find some time series analysis code implementations like:
- dynamic time warping (DTW), 
- symbolic aggregate approximation (SaX)
- Complementary Filter
- Quaternion ops
- z-Normalization

Also you can find about:
- Virtual Joypad usage code
- 100Hz (maximum rate of Fusion'ed output of BNO055) BNO055 IMU data handler code
- etc.
